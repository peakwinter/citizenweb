## 3.3.1 - Take Inventory

First things first, let's take a look at all the parts we have received for our computer and make sure we have everything we need. 

* Motherboard and CPU
* Memory (RAM)
* Case and Power Supply
* Hard Drive(s) and/or CD/DVD drive
* Monitor, keyboard and mouse

With your hard drive and disk drives, you should have received a set of Serial ATA (SATA) cables. Make sure you have those handy. You will also need ethernet cable(s), and the power cable that came with your power supply.

Throughout this process you will want to make sure that you are in a static-free environment. It's not a good idea to put together your sensitive electronic components on a carpet, for example. Every once in awhile, it is good to touch a "ground" to make sure you are free of static electricity. The screws in wall-mounted power ports usually suffice for this.

Last but definitely not least, you will need a Phillips head screwdriver to fix the proper components into place. Let's get to it!

## 3.3.2 - Assemble the Motherboard and CPU

The first step is to gently unpack your motherboard and lay it in your workspace. You will be confronted with something that looks similar to this:
